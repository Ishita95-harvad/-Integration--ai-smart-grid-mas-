# SmartGrid MAS Simulation

This project demonstrates AI-powered energy efficiency in smart grids using Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and solar data.

## Structure
- `data/`: Simulated CSVs (SOC, solar irradiance, etc.)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for forecasting and optimization
- `app/`: Streamlit dashboard
- `figures/`: Visualizations (SOC heatmap, solar forecast, etc.)
- `models/`: ML models (e.g., Prophet, LSTM)
