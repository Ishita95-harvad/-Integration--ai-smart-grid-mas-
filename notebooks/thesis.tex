% Abstract
\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
The global transition to sustainable energy systems necessitates advanced solutions for managing the complexities of smart grids, particularly in integrating renewable energy sources like solar power. This thesis proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize energy distribution and consumption in smart grids, with a focus on energy efficiency and resilience in India’s solar energy landscape. By leveraging reinforcement learning (RL), genetic algorithms (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), the system autonomously balances energy generation, storage, and consumption. A hybrid forecasting approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Prophet, and ARIMA models enhances prediction accuracy for demand and renewable generation. The framework integrates climate-responsive strategies, utilizing real-time data from sources like the Indian Meteorological Department and NASA EarthData to adapt to environmental variability.

Simulation results conducted in GridLAB-D for a Rohtak microgrid demonstrate a 15.2\% energy efficiency gain, 20\% increase in renewable utilization, 30\% cost reduction (₹350/day), and a 20\% reduction in CO$_2$ emissions. The system achieved a response time of under 100ms and maintained 72-hour operational continuity during a simulated hurricane scenario. The MAS framework aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and ISO 50001 standards, offering a scalable, resilient, and sustainable solution for modern energy systems. Challenges such as data heterogeneity, computational overhead, and regulatory barriers are identified, with recommendations for future enhancements, including federated learning, blockchain integration, and large-scale pilot deployments.

% Chapter 1: Introduction
\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background and Motivation}
The global energy demand has surged due to urbanization, population growth, and reliance on electricity-dependent technologies. Traditional power grids, designed for centralized energy flows, struggle with the variability of renewable sources like solar and wind, leading to inefficiencies such as high transmission losses and suboptimal load balancing. Smart grids, integrating digital communication, sensors, and automation, offer a solution by enabling real-time monitoring and dynamic energy management. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), enhances smart grid capabilities by facilitating decentralized decision-making and coordination. This thesis proposes an AI-driven MAS framework using reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization techniques to improve energy efficiency, renewable integration, and grid stability, with a focus on India’s solar energy landscape.

\section{Problem Statement}
Centralized grids face inefficiencies, as evidenced by the Texas 2021 outage (\$200 billion in damages) and India’s 2022 blackout, caused by grid overload and lack of adaptability. In India, heterogeneous infrastructure and protocol fragmentation hinder microgrid deployment. This thesis addresses these challenges by developing a scalable MAS framework for microgrids in Rohtak, Haryana, aiming to enhance energy efficiency and resilience.

\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop an MAS framework using RL and JADE to improve smart grid efficiency by at least 15\%.
    \item Evaluate performance in energy savings, cost reduction, and scalability.
    \item Identify deployment challenges in India’s solar context.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Hypothesis}: The MAS framework outperforms centralized systems in efficiency and adaptability.

\chapter{Background and Literature Review}
\section{Smart Grids}
Smart grids integrate information and communication technologies (ICT) for efficient energy production, distribution, and consumption. They support bidirectional communication, decentralized energy models, and self-healing mechanisms, reducing transmission losses and enhancing reliability.

\section{Energy Efficiency in Smart Grids}
Energy efficiency minimizes waste through demand-side management (DSM), time-of-use pricing, and automated auditing. Demand Response (DR) and load forecasting optimize energy flows, reducing peak demand and operational costs.

\section{Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Energy Systems}
AI and ML enhance smart grids through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables adaptive decision-making, while neural networks improve forecasting accuracy.
